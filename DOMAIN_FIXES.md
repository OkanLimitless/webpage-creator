# Domain Deployment Fixes

This document provides an overview of the changes we've made to fix issues with domain deployments, particularly the "ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS" error that was occurring with custom domains and the associated issues with Google Ads compatibility.

## Latest Fix: Static HTML Deployment

We've completely replaced the redirection-based approach with a static HTML deployment that directly serves the root page content. This ensures:

1. No redirects occur - Google Ads is now fully compatible
2. Root page content is displayed immediately
3. Fast page loading with static content

The static HTML approach:
- Pulls the root page content directly from our database during deployment
- Generates a static HTML file with the exact content and styling
- Deploys this file to Vercel as a static site (not a Next.js app)
- Creates a root page in the database automatically if one doesn't exist

## How to Apply the Fix

### For All Domains

Run the redeployment script to apply the fix to all domains at once:

```bash
node scripts/redeploy-domains-with-html.js
```

This script will:
1. Find all active domains in the database
2. Generate static HTML from their root page content
3. Redeploy each domain with the static HTML approach
4. Update their deployment status in the database

### For Specific Domains

To fix a specific domain:

1. Use the admin interface to redeploy the domain
2. Or use the CLI tool:
   ```bash
   node scripts/fix-domain.js your-domain.com
   ```

## Verifying the Fix

After applying the fix, you should:

1. Visit the domain in your browser
2. Verify that you see the actual root page content (not a "Redirecting..." message)
3. Check that no redirects occur (you can use browser developer tools to verify)
4. Test compatibility with Google Ads by submitting the domain

If the domain shows the proper HTML content without redirecting, the fix was successful.

## Technical Details

The new approach works by:

1. **During Deployment**:
   - The system checks if a root page exists in the database for the domain
   - If one exists, it generates static HTML from the root page content
   - If none exists, it creates one and then generates the HTML
   - The HTML is deployed as a static file to Vercel with proper caching headers

2. **When Accessed**:
   - The domain serves the static HTML file directly
   - No server-side processing or redirects occur
   - Content loads quickly as it's pre-rendered

This approach is ideal for:
- Google Ads compatibility (no redirects)
- Performance (static HTML is fast)
- SEO (search engines prefer content that doesn't redirect)

## Previous Fixes

Previous iterations included:
- Removing server-side redirects in Next.js
- Adding client-side redirect with delay
- Improving cache headers
- Ensuring proper Cloudflare DNS configuration (DNS-only mode)

These have been superseded by the static HTML approach which eliminates redirects entirely.
